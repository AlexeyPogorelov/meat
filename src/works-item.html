				<h3>New Shop on the Block: Twigy Posts</h3>
				<p><span class="color">Google’s Material</span> Design continues to be a popular approach to contemporary web design. An almost-flat style, the set of principles — originally designed as brand guidelines for Google — describe a layer-based approach to UI design. Aside from the prescriptive color scheme, the carefully neutral typography, and Disney-esque animation, Material Design’s floating button concept is perhaps the most recognizable aspect of the style. However, the Floating Action Button appears to be following the same trajectory as the Hamburger Menu; from saviour to pariah in a few short months.</p>
				<p>Floating Action Buttons sit apart from the rest of a UI, styled to appear as if floating over the top of content. Almost exclusively a circle, they’re a pleasingly minimal shape, that lends itself to animation. Floating Action Buttons are the natural evolution of the sticky header that have been popular for the last few years. The leap Google made to move beyond the sticky header was to decouple the Floating Action.</p>
